## Calc Games

This project is a set of mini-games launched from the console. 
The games are designed to be both fun and educational, testing and improving your mathematical skills. 
The project is implemented in JavaScript and utilizes a number of technologies and libraries.


### Technologies

-   JavaScript (ES6)
-   Node.js
-   JSDoc
-   npm
-   readline-sync
-   GitHub Actions
-   ESLint

### Games Included

The project includes several mini-games, each focusing on different mathematical concepts:

- `brain-calc.js`: A game where the user is asked to calculate the result of an arithmetic expression.
- `brain-even.js`: A game where the user needs to determine if a number is even.
- `brain-gcd.js`: A game to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- `brain-prime.js`: A game where the user should determine if a number is prime.
- `brain-progression.js`: A game where the user needs to find the missing number in an arithmetic progression.

### Installation

To install the games, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. After that, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/opifexM/CalcGames.git
cd CalcGames
npm install
```

### Usage
After installation, you can run any game directly from the command line. 

To play the "brain-games" game:
```bash
npm run brain-games
```

To play the "brain-even" game:
```bash
npm run brain-even
```

To play the "brain-calc" game:
```bash
npm run brain-calc
```

To play the "brain-gcd" game:
```bash
npm run brain-gcd
```

To play the "brain-progression" game:
```bash
npm run brain-progression
```

To play the "brain-prime" game:
```bash
npm run brain-prime
```
